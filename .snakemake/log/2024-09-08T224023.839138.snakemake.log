MissingOutputException in rule download_pine_martin_sightings in file /Users/chrisbutler/Documents/pine_martin/pine_martin, line 1:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
outputs/pine_martins_sightings.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: .DS_Store)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
