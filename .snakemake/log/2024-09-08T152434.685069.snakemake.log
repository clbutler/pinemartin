MissingOutputException in rule clean_pine_martin_sightings in file /Users/chrisbutler/Documents/pine_martin/pine_martin, line 9:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
outputs/pine_martins_sightings_plot.pdf (missing locally, parent dir contents: .DS_Store, pine_martins_sightings_clean.csv, pine_martins_sightings.csv)
Removing output files of failed job clean_pine_martin_sightings since they might be corrupted:
outputs/pine_martins_sightings_clean.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
